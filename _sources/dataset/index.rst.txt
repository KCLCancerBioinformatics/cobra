Dataset
===================


The dataset comprises of over 6,000 histopathology whole-slide-images of basal cell carcinoma skin cancer, which is the most commonly diagnosed cancer. The dataset is divided into four groups and includes biopsies and excisions. This dataset provides valuable insights into the characteristics of various types of skin cancer and will be released over the year in stages.

Group 1: BCC biopsies
----------------------

The first group of the dataset includes around 2,500 BCC biopsies with subtype labels. Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common form of skin cancer, and it is important to understand the different subtypes of BCC to develop effective treatments.

Group 2: Non-BCC biopsies
--------------------------

The second group of the dataset contains 2,500 non-BCC biopsies with different types of skin dysplasia. Skin dysplasia refers to the abnormal growth or development of skin cells, which can lead to the development of skin cancer.

Group 3: Risky tumor biopsies
-----------------------------

The third group of the dataset has 1,000 labelled risky tumor biopsies, including rare and dangerous types like melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma. These types of skin cancer are more aggressive and require more intensive treatment, making this dataset an important resource for medical research and development of effective treatments.

Group 4: BCC excisions
-----------------------

The final group of the dataset contains 1,000 BCC excisions with or without free tumor margins, with 300 fully annotated. This group provides valuable information on the efficacy of surgical treatments for BCC, including the importance of free tumor margins for successful treatment.

Conclusion
----------

In summary, the dataset provides a comprehensive collection of medical images of histopathology whole-slide-images from basal cell carcinoma skin cancer, including biopsies and excisions. The dataset will be released over the year in stages, starting with the BCC and non-BCC biopsies, followed by BCC excisions, and finally the risky tumor biopsies. This dataset will serve as a valuable resource for medical research and development of effective treatments for various types of skin cancer.
