Tools
===================================

Introduction
------------

Here you can find useful packages, tools and libraries to work with multiresolutional data.

WholeSlideData and ASAP
------------------------

One package that we would recommend is using WholeSlideData in combination with ASAP. WholeSlideData is a Python package for working with large, multiresolutional whole-slide images, while ASAP is a popular tool for viewing and annotating whole-slide images.

Using WholeSlideData and ASAP together allows you to easily load and view large whole-slide images, while also providing powerful annotation tools for marking regions of interest within the images. This combination is particularly useful for medical research and diagnosis, where whole-slide images are commonly used for analyzing tissue samples.
